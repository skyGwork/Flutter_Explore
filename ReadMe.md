# [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)

> [Test drive ](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal) This page describes how to create a new Flutter app from templates, run it, and experience “hot reload” after you make changes to the app.

- `flutter create my_app`
- Select your development tool of choice for writing, building, and running Flutter apps.

> [Use a custom font](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#from-packages) Although Android and iOS offer high quality system fonts, one of the most common requests from designers is for custom fonts. For example, you might have a custom-built font from a designer, or perhaps you downloaded a font from Google Fonts.

> [Asset images in package dependencies](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/assets-and-images#from-packages) To load an image from a package dependency, the package argument must be provided to AssetImage.

> [Declaring resolution-aware image assets](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware) AssetImage understands how to map a logical requested asset onto one that most closely matches the current device pixel ratio. In order for this mapping to work, assets should be arranged according to a particular directory structure:

> [The pubspec file](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec) Every pub package needs some metadata so it can specify its dependencies. Pub packages that are shared with others also need to provide some other information so users can discover them.

> [Version your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning) Versioning is a critical component of your app upgrade and maintenance strategy. Versioning is important because:

> [Core Foundation Keys](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html) The Core Foundation framework provides the underlying infrastructure for bundles, including the code used at runtime to load bundles and parse their structure. As a result, many of the keys recognized by this framework are fundamental to the definition of bundles themselves and are instrumental in determining the contents of a bundle.
